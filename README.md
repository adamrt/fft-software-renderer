# Heretic

Heretic is a software renderer for viewing maps from the PSX Final Fantasy Tactics bin file. You can also view my notes and the [development history](HISTORY.md).

### Running

You will need your copy of the PSX Final Fantasy Tactics bin file (not the iso).

```go run *.go <path to file>```
